# Keeping sanity and editing for figures:
## Rules:
	1. All the figures(svg, pdf, png) which are common in scripts and lecture slides needs to be placed here.
	2. svg and pdf folders should contain the respective formats of each image. 
	** pdf format images could also be edited in INKSCAPE directly **. But it is better to have the svg natively.
	3. If there are some png images used inside the svg figure, place them in "/png/used_in_svg/". This is not ideal. Place other png files in "/png/"

	4. If svg has links to png files, use pdf in inkscape directly and save as svg.

	
	suggestion> rename png to graphics or similar
